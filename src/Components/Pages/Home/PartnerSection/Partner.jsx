              We see a huge opportunity with expanding business relations
              between Korea and the MENA region. Yet, at the same time, from
              marketing and exposure to the distance between the two areas,
              there are a lot of moving parts that need to be handled. We feel
              as your focused expert; weâ€™re able to be the missing connection
              link between both worlds.
